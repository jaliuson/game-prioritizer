# Game Prioritizer

Increase game perforance and stabilize fps by automatically increasing the Windows priority of the specific processes. This will help keep the negative or slowign effect of background apps and prosseces to a minimal amount and make games run better.

## Who is this for?
Someone who is ready to break their monitor over jittery gameplay
You'll find the most use out of this fix if:
1. You experience significant fps fluctuations while gaming
1. The range of these fluctuations often go above and below your monitor refresh rate

## How does it work
This script is mostly intended for automating the tedious process of manually increasing the priority of the process in Windows Task Manager. This the script simply works the same as the common fix where one would:
2. Open Task Manager
2. Expand "VALORANT"
2. > go to details
2. Set priority to "HIGH"
2. Set affinity to (everything but cpu 0) 

## How do I use it
tbd - still a work in progress

## Is this legal?

Valorant will ban you for the use of third party apps, does this count, I'm not sure and am too lazy to look into it so use at your own risk, but if i get banned I'll say something and cry because my ruin dagger is lost forever

tldr: no idea, but i hope so

update: Actually I think it is legal because process lasso does practically the same thing
